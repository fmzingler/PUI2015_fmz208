For this assignment, I used SPYDER to create all the codes and then uploaded to ipython notebook, making the changes and details to guarantee that they run.
Original python code included on repo.
All the libraries used are available in Anaconda. 
All python functions searched on ScyPy.

ASSIGNEMENT 1
1) generate 100 samples with same population mean
population mean was adopted as 500 (mymean)
- Normal Distribution: done
- Poisson Distribution: done
- Binomial Distribution: done
- Chi-Sqaured Distribution: done
- 2 of choice: Exponential and Logistic: done

2) For all distributions plot sample mean against sample size N and commment behavior of plot:
plots can be visualized on ipython notebook, also represented below:
- Normal Distribution: regular distribuition of sample size and sample mean, expeced the shape of the plot to be more disperse.

- Poisson Distribution: concentration of points on lower sample size.

- Binomial Distribution: more dispersed with increase of sample size, more values below the mean.

- Chi-Sqaured Distribution: very disperse around the mean.

- Exponential Distribution:dispersed distribuition, expected to happen.

-Logistic Distribution: disperse distribuition with visible outliers of sample size (larger values).

3) plot sample means together
![Alt text](https://github.com/fmzingler/PUI2015_fmz208/blob/master/Homework3/Histogram.png)
this plot shows that the sample size tens to be very large around the mean, which is expected accoriding to the amount of incidents around the meaan for each individual distribution.

ASSIGNMENT 2
Comments and results inside the ipython notebook, as follows the script given in class with modification for the new rows and parameters.
