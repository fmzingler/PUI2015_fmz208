Content:
- Including an axis just for female or male, or even for race is not a good option, there are other variables more relevante (age, school degree)
- 2D display would be good enought for this plot.

Display:
- The color scheme is good for display
- The difference display is crossing some lines between the points, it's not confusing but it's not visually pleasant.
- Extreme points are too big.
