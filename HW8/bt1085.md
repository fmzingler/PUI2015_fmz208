Content:
- The title does not fully explain the plot (socioeconomical information included)
- No density information plotted
- Per capita emmission and population emmissions - maybe we could show other info that can provide extra details and lead to better  conclusions when aanalyzing the plots.


Display:
- Display is clear, but difficult to visualize position of the bublles in tridimentional space.
- Highighted bubble with no explanation/meaning (is it the highest, maybe a caption would help)
- Empty space on the left side, caption too close to limits on right side.
